          <p>
            I&apos;m <strong className="font-medium text-foreground">Andrej</strong>, and I created Kaneo because I was tired of project management tools
            that got in the way more than they helped. After years of using bloated, overcomplicated platforms that
            <strong className="font-medium text-foreground"> distracted from actual work</strong>, I knew there had to be a better way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem wasn&apos;t that these tools lacked features - it was that they had
            <strong className="font-medium text-foreground"> too many</strong>. Every notification, every unnecessary button, every complex workflow was
            pulling my team away from what mattered: <strong className="font-medium text-foreground">building great products</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe the best tools are <strong className="font-medium text-foreground">invisible</strong>. They should amplify your team&apos;s natural workflow,
            not force you to adapt to theirs. Kaneo is built on the principle that
            <strong className="font-medium text-foreground"> less is more</strong> - every feature exists because it solves a real problem, not because it
            looks impressive in a demo.
